  "challenge": "The Ada community faced critical water access challenges with contaminated sources affecting over 5,000 residents. Traditional water management systems had broken down, and there was limited community capacity for sustainable resource management.",
  "approach": "We facilitated a participatory planning process bringing together community leaders, women's groups, and local government. Together we mapped water resources, identified contamination sources, and co-designed a community-managed water system. We provided training in water quality monitoring, financial management, and governance structures for the water committee.",
  "outcomes": [
    "Established 3 new community-managed water points serving 5,200 residents",
    "Trained 25 community members in water quality testing and maintenance",
    "Reduced waterborne illness reports by 62% in the first year [placeholder]",
    "Created a sustainable revenue model with 95% collection rate for water fees",
    "Established a women-led water management committee"
