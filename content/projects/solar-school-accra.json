  "challenge": "A primary school serving 400 students had no reliable electricity, limiting teaching hours and preventing use of educational technology. High energy costs from diesel generators were unsustainable for the school budget.",
  "approach": "We conducted an energy audit and co-designed a solar solution with school administrators, teachers, and the parent-teacher association. We facilitated access to clean energy financing, supervised installation, and trained staff in system maintenance. We also integrated energy education into the school curriculum.",
  "outcomes": [
    "Installed 15kW solar system providing 100% daytime power needs",
    "Reduced school energy costs by 78% annually",
    "Extended teaching hours by 3 hours daily with evening classes",
    "Enabled computer lab serving 400 students",
    "Created 2 local jobs for system maintenance"
